"3","FSMO Roles","Get-FSMO","Heading 2","Schema Master FSMO Role
The schema master FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for performing updates to the directory schema (that is, the schema naming context or LDAP://cn=schema,cn=configuration,dc=<domain>). This DC is the only one that can process updates to the directory schema. Once the Schema update is complete, it is replicated from the schema master to all other DCs in the directory. There is only one schema master per directory. 

Domain Naming Master FSMO Role
The domain naming master FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for making changes to the forest-wide domain name space of the directory (that is, the Partitions\Configuration naming context or LDAP://CN=Partitions, CN=Configuration, DC=<domain>). This DC is the only one that can add or remove a domain from the directory. It can also add or remove cross references to domains in external directories. 

RID Master FSMO Role
The RID master FSMO role holder is the single DC responsible for processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within a given domain. It is also responsible for removing an object from its domain and putting it in another domain during an object move. 

 When a DC creates a security principal object such as a user or group, it attaches a unique Security ID (SID) to the object. This SID consists of a domain SID (the same for all SIDs created in a domain), and a relative ID (RID) that is unique for each security principal SID created in a domain. 

 Each Windows 2000 DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it is allowed to assign to the security principals it creates. When a DC's allocated RID pool falls below a threshold, that DC issues a request for additional RIDs to the domain's RID master. The domain RID master responds to the request by retrieving RIDs from the domain's unallocated RID pool and assigns them to the pool of the requesting DC. There is one RID master per domain in a directory. 

PDC Emulator FSMO Role
The PDC emulator is necessary to synchronize time in an enterprise. Windows 2000 includes the W32Time (Windows Time) time service that is required by the Kerberos authentication protocol. All Windows 2000-based computers within an enterprise use a common time. The purpose of the time service is to ensure that the Windows Time service uses a hierarchical relationship that controls authority and does not permit loops to ensure appropriate common time usage.

 The PDC emulator of a domain is authoritative for the domain. The PDC emulator at the root of the forest becomes authoritative for the enterprise, and should be configured to gather the time from an external source. All PDC FSMO role holders follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their in-bound time partner.

Infrastructure FSMO Role
When an object in one domain is referenced by another object in another domain, it represents the reference by the GUID, the SID (for references to security principals), and the DN of the object being referenced. The infrastructure FSMO role holder is the DC responsible for updating an object's SID and distinguished name in a cross-domain object reference. 

NOTE: The Infrastructure Master (IM) role should be held by a domain controller that is not a Global Catalog server(GC). If the Infrastructure Master runs on a Global Catalog server it will stop updating object information because it does not contain any references to objects that it does not hold. This is because a Global Catalog server holds a partial replica of every object in the forest. As a result, cross-domain object references in that domain will not be updated and a warning to that effect will be logged on that DC's event log.

"12","Exchange Server Roles","get-ExRoles","Heading 1","Mailbox Server: This is a back-end server that hosts mailboxes, public folders, and related messaging data, such as address lists, resource scheduling, and meeting items. For high availability of mailbox databases, you can use database availability groups.

Client Access Server: This is a middle-tier server that accepts connections to Exchange Server from a variety of clients. This server hosts the protocols used by all clients when checking messages. On the local network, Outlook MAPI clients are connected directly to the Client Access server to check mail. Remote users can check their mail over the Internet by using Outlook Anywhere, Outlook Web App, Exchange ActiveSync, POP3, or IMAP4.

 Unified Messaging Server: This is a middle-tier server that integrates a private branch exchange (PBX) system with Exchange Server, allowing voice messages and faxes to be stored with e-mail in a users mailbox. Unified messaging supports call answering with automated greetings and message recording, fax receiving, and dial-in access. With dial-in access, users can use Outlook Voice Access to check voice mail, e-mail, and calendar information; to review or dial contacts; and to configure preferences and personal options. Note that to receive faxes, you need an integrated solution from a Microsoft partner.

 Hub Transport Server: This is a mail routing server that handles mail flow, routing, and delivery within the Exchange organization. This server processes all mail that is sent inside the organization before it is delivered to a mailbox in the organization or routed to users outside the organization. Processing ensures that senders and recipients are resolved and filtered as appropriate, content is filtered and has its format converted if necessary, and attachments are screened. To meet any regulatory or organizational compliance requirements, the Hub Transport server can also record, or journal, messages and add disclaimers to them. 

Edge Transport Server This serves as an additional mail routing server that routes mail into and out of the Exchange organization. This server is designed to be deployed in an organization perimeter network and is used to establish a secure boundary between the organization and the Internet. This server accepts mail coming into the organization from the Internet and from trusted servers in external organizations, processes the mail to protect against some types of spam messages and viruses, and routes all accepted messages to a Hub Transport server inside the organization.

"14","Journaling Information","get-ExJournal","Heading 1","Journaling can help your organization respond to legal, regulatory, and organizational compliance requirements by recording inbound and outbound email communications. 

You can implement targeted journaling rules by specifying the SMTP address of the recipient you want to journal. The recipient can be an Exchange mailbox, distribution group, mail user, or contact. These recipients may be subject to regulatory requirements, or they may be involved in legal proceedings where email messages or other communications are collected as evidence. By targeting specific recipients or groups of recipients, you can easily configure a journaling environment that matches your organization's processes and meets regulatory and legal requirements. Targeting only the specific recipients that need to be journaled also minimizes storage and other costs associated with retention of large amounts of data. 

All messages sent to or from the journaling recipients you specify in a journaling rule are journaled. If you specify a distribution group as the journaling recipient, all messages sent to or from members of the distribution group are journaled. If you don't specify a journaling recipient, all messages sent to or from recipients that match the journal rule scope are journaled.

You can use Autodiscover to find the Exchange Web Services (EWS) endpoint for a mailbox and other associated mailbox information. Autodiscover provides configuration information to client applications that are inside or outside firewalls and will work in resource forest and multiple forest scenarios.

The Autodiscover service is a web service that provides Exchange server configuration information to your client application. Client applications use Autodiscover to determine the endpoint of the Autodiscover service for a specific mailbox. For applications that have access to an organization's Active Directory directory service or Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), you can use SCP record lookup to find the Autodiscover endpoint without exposing the Autodiscover service to the Internet.

/owa This is the directory for OWA (Outlook Web Access on Exchange 2007, and now called Outlook Web App on Exchange 2010), which is the web browser version of Outlook that is usually accessed by remote workers.  The /owa directory is for access to Exchange 2007,2010 or 2013 mailboxes.

/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync This directory is for ActiveSync clients to connect to mailboxes.  These are typically mobile phones or smart phones that have an ActiveSync-compatible email application./OAB This directory publishes the Offline Address Book for clients running Outlook 2007 and above.  Earlier versions of Outlook download the OAB from Public Folders instead.

/Autodiscover This directory publishes Autodiscover information.  Clients running Outlook 2007 and above, and some ActiveSync clients, can query Autodiscover for a users mailbox configuration and automatically set up the mail profile without the end user needing to enter details such as server names.

/EWS This directory publishes Exchange Web Services, a new programming API that makes Exchange data available to third party applications.

/Rpc and /RpcWithCert - these directories are for Outlook Anywhere, which was formerly known as RPC-over-HTTPS.  As the name suggests, this allowed Outlook clients to make an RPC connection to the Exchange server over an SSL encrypted tunnel from anywhere, making it possible for staff on the road to continue using Outlook without interruption./ecp This directory, again new to Exchange 2010, publishes a self-service control panel for administrators and users.  A broad range of administrative tasks can be delegated to power users and made accessible through the Exchange Control Panel, such as creating new distribution groups and managing SMTP addresses for mailbox users.  Normal users can also access self-service options such as updating their personal information.

With RBAC, you don't need to modify and manage access control lists (ACLs), which was done in Exchange Server 2007. ACLs created several challenges in Exchange 2007, such as modifying ACLs without causing unintended consequences, maintaining ACL modifications through upgrades, and troubleshooting problems that occurred due to using ACLs in a nonstandard way. 

RBAC enables you to control, at both broad and granular levels, what administrators and end-users can do. RBAC also enables you to more closely align the roles you assign users and administrators to the actual roles they hold within your organization. In Exchange 2007, the server permissions model applied only to the administrators who managed the Exchange 2007 infrastructure. In Exchange 2013, RBAC now controls both the administrative tasks that can be performed and the extent to which users can now administer their own mailbox and distribution groups.

RBAC has two primary ways of assigning permissions to users in your organization, depending on whether the user is an administrator or specialist user, or an end-user: management role groups and management role assignment policies. Each method associates users with the permissions they need to perform their jobs.
