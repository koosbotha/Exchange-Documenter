# Exchange-Documenter
This Tool provided is intended to make it simple and customizable, with little amount of PowerShell knowledge.
The tool consists of several files and directories
.\Main.ps1				
.\Template.doc
.\Includes\ADsettings.ps1
.\Includes\Application.ps1
.\Includes\Exchange.ps1
.\Includes\WMICollection.ps1
.\Includes\ExchangeContent.xml
.\Includes\wmiContent.XML
.\Includes\Formats.ps1

The ps1 files contains all the logic and functions used. The .csv files contains the content being used.

So what is required?
•	PowerShell 2.0 or higher
•	The machine collecting information requires the Active PowerShell modules
•	The Document generation machine “if different requires” Word 2007 or higher.
•	Your script Execution policy might be required to be changed using Set-ExecutionPolicy

Running it (“Collecting information and building document”)
Note: All files are required for both processes to complete successfully
1.	Execute main.ps1 with PowerShell in Administrators Mode
	"A form windows  will appear"
2.	\Main.ps1 -CollectInformation -ExchangeServer <ServerName> 
	This will collect all information necessary to build the document. The script will create a directory .\Data\ if not already created and populate it with the extracted information.
3.	Once this process is complete, you can Exit or run ".\Main.ps1 -GenerateReport". IF the machine collecting the information does not have word installed. 
4.	Copy the "Data" directory over to the machine where you want the document generated and into the root where the main.ps1 and template.doc files are located. 
5.	Run the main.ps1 once more.
6.	".\Main.ps1 -GenerateReport".
7.	Once it done, a new file would have been generated in the root directory with the a time stamped name. 
8.	“It’s done, your document is build”.

How to modify the content.
The Content can easily be modified by simply editing the xml files. If you do not require section in the ford, simply remove from the xml file.
